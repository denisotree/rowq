## Highlights

- **Tabular and structured formats** — CSV (auto-delimiter), TSV, JSON, JSONL/NDJSON,
  YAML, TOML, Parquet, Arrow/Feather, Excel (xlsx/xls), SQLite, DuckDB, and Markdown
  with frontmatter. Databases are recognised by their header, whatever the file is
  called. Browse a whole directory, or pipe data in over stdin.
- **Nested data, edited in place** — JSON/YAML/TOML open as a table over the real
  document: `Enter` dives into a nested object or list, `(` expands a nested column
  into one column per key, `m` switches between record and key/value layouts, and edits
  write back into the document, not into a flattened copy. Saving re-serialises the
  tree, so structure survives.
- **Files larger than memory** — a JSONL file of gigabytes opens at once in the
  terminal and fills in behind the sheet as you look at it, taking about its own size
  in memory; the MCP server streams CSV, TSV, Parquet, Arrow and JSONL past a
  sixteenth of its memory budget, so `frequency` over a 16 GB log holds the counts,
  not the file.
- **Vim-style navigation** — `hjkl`, `gg`/`G`, page jumps, sticky pinned columns.
- **Instant analysis** — per-column statistics, frequency tables, and charts
  (histogram, bar, line, grouped bar) rendered right in the terminal.
- **Reshape on the fly** — pivot tables, JOINs across files, a `git diff`-style
  comparison of two tables, transpose, group by,
  deduplication, computed columns and window functions (rank, running total,
  lag/lead, share of a group) from an expression language with `and` / `or` / `not`.
- **Clean, fast, type-aware** — Polars-backed engine, Everforest theme, undo/redo,
  currency / percentage / date column types.
- **Build a database from nothing** — `rowq inventory.sqlite` on a file that does not
  exist opens a blank sheet. Add columns (`zi`), give them types (`t`), add rows (`o`,
  or `O` for a form that checks each value against its column type), `Ctrl+S`. rowq
  asks what to call the table and writes a real
  typed one: an Integer column is declared `INTEGER` and stores integers, NULL stays
  NULL. SQLite and DuckDB both.
- **Edit a database table and save it back** — open a SQLite or DuckDB table, edit
  cells, delete or paste rows, add/drop/rename columns, then `Ctrl+S` onto the same
  file. rowq shows every `ALTER TABLE`/`UPDATE`/`INSERT`/`DELETE` it is about to run
  and waits for confirmation, then runs them in one transaction; the rest of the
  database — other tables, indexes, views, triggers — is untouched. Reordering columns
  (and changing a type on SQLite) rebuilds the table, which the popup says out loud
  first. Anything the engine would reject, or that a rebuild could not carry across
  intact, is refused with a sentence before a single statement runs. Save to a different `.db` instead and the
  whole database is copied first, leaving the original alone. NULL is shown as `NULL`
  and typed as `\N`, so it never silently becomes an empty string.
- **Export and convert** — write back to CSV, TSV, Parquet, Arrow, JSON, JSONL, YAML,
  TOML, Excel, SQLite, or DuckDB. Converting between structured formats is just a
  different extension: open `config.toml`, save as `config.yaml`. Markdown is read
  only — a page comes in as a row, and nothing writes one back out. Yank rows to the
  clipboard as TSV, CSV, JSON, or Markdown.
- **MCP server** — `rowq --mcp` exposes the same engine to an AI assistant, so it
  computes over your data instead of guessing at it. It reads databases properly:
  tables *and* views, with each column's declared SQL type, keys and defaults.
  Add `--mcp-write` and it can change things too — rows in a table, a table
  replaced wholesale, a file overwritten — but never in one call: the first
  returns the exact statements and what they would destroy, and writes nothing,
  so the assistant has to show you what it is about to run. Creating something
  that does not exist yet needs no flag and no handshake; there is nothing there
  to lose.

## See it in action

### Charts — histogram, bar, line, grouped bar

Press `V` on any column. Numeric columns get a Freedman–Diaconis histogram;
categorical columns get a frequency bar chart. [Pin](#keybindings) a date or
category column first with `!` to draw line charts and grouped bars.

![Charts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denisotree/rowq/master/.github/assets/charts.gif)

### Pivot tables

Pin the column(s) to group by, place the cursor on the column to spread across,
press `W`, and type an aggregation formula such as `sum(revenue)`.

![Pivot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denisotree/rowq/master/.github/assets/pivot.gif)

### JOIN across files

Press `J` for a step-by-step wizard: pick another file (or an open sheet),
choose `INNER` / `LEFT` / `RIGHT` / `OUTER` / `ANTI` / `SEMI`, and select the key
columns. `DIFF` compares two tables like `git diff`: unchanged, changed (with the
differing cells marked), removed and added rows, each in its own colour.

![JOIN](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denisotree/rowq/master/.github/assets/join.gif)

### Computed columns

Press `=` and type an expression. Arithmetic, string and date functions, and
conditionals are all supported — the new column appears right next to the cursor.

![Computed columns](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denisotree/rowq/master/.github/assets/compute.gif)

### Editing a database table

Open a SQLite or DuckDB table, edit it, and `Ctrl+S` back onto the same file.
Every `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, `DELETE` and `ALTER TABLE` is shown before anything
runs, and the whole list goes in one transaction.

![Editing a database table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denisotree/rowq/master/.github/assets/database.gif)

### The new-row form

`O` builds a form out of the sheet: one field per column, labelled with its type
and checked as you type. A value the column cannot hold is refused with the
reason instead of quietly turning the column into text.

![The new-row form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denisotree/rowq/master/.github/assets/rowform.gif)

### JSON, YAML and TOML as a document

`Enter` dives into a nested object or list, edits write back into the document
rather than a flattened copy, and converting is just a different extension.

## Installation

### Cargo (crates.io)

```sh
cargo install rowq
```

Installs the `rowq` command.

To skip the build, [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall)
fetches the pre-built binary from the release instead:

```sh
cargo binstall rowq
```

### Homebrew (macOS / Linux)

```sh
brew tap denisotree/rowq
brew install rowq
```

### Arch Linux (AUR)

```sh
yay -S rowq            # pre-built binary: rowq-bin
# or build from source:
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/rowq.git && cd rowq && makepkg -si
```

### Debian / Ubuntu (APT)

```sh
curl -fsSL https://apt.rowq.dev/rowq.gpg \
  | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/rowq.gpg > /dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/rowq.gpg] https://apt.rowq.dev stable main" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rowq.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install rowq
```

`apt upgrade` then picks up new releases. amd64 and arm64; Debian 12+ and Ubuntu
22.04+. A single `.deb` is also attached to every
[release](https://github.com/denisotree/rowq/releases): `sudo apt install ./rowq_*.deb`.

### Pre-built binaries

Grab a tarball for your platform (Linux / macOS, x86_64 / aarch64) from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/denisotree/rowq/releases).

<details>
<summary><b>Building from source</b></summary>

```sh
cargo build --release
```

The default build bundles DuckDB and SQLite from source, so the binary is fully
self-contained — no system libraries required. This compiles DuckDB's C++ core
(~10 min the first time; a C++17 compiler is needed).

To skip that and link a **system** DuckDB instead — it has to be DuckDB 2.0, which
some distributions do not ship yet:

```sh
brew install duckdb                # macOS
sudo apt install libduckdb-dev     # Debian / Ubuntu
cargo build --release --no-default-features
```

| Feature | Default | Description |
|---------|:-------:|-------------|
| `bundled-duckdb` | ✓ | Compile DuckDB from source; no system `libduckdb` needed |

</details>

## Quick start

```sh
cargo install rowq
rowq data.csv
```

- Move with `h` `j` `k` `l`; jump with `gg` / `G`.
- Sort the current column: `[` ascending, `]` descending, `r` to reset;
  `z[` / `z]` add a second key.
- Chart it: `V`. Per-column stats: `I`. Frequency table: `F`. Group by pinned
  columns: `gb`. Rank, running total or a group share: `zw`.
- Select rows by an expression: `|!=amount > 1000`.
- Add a column: `=` then e.g. `revenue / units`.
- Save / export: `Ctrl+S`. Quit: `q`. Help at any time: `?`.

## Usage

```text
rowq [OPTIONS] [FILES]...

Arguments:
  [FILES]...  One or more files to open, a directory, a quoted glob pattern,
              or '-' for stdin. Pass multiple files to browse them as a list.
              Defaults to the current directory.

Options:
  -d, --delimiter <CHAR>   Column delimiter (auto-detected if omitted)
  -t, --type <FORMAT>      Data format (csv, tsv, txt, parquet, arrow, xlsx,
                           sqlite, duckdb, json, jsonl, yaml, toml, md).
                           Required for stdin, which takes csv, tsv, txt,
                           json, jsonl, yaml and toml; for a file it overrides
                           the extension and content detection, so
                           `-t yaml deploy.conf` and `-t csv export.dat` work
      --mcp                Run as an MCP server on stdio (see below)
      --mcp-write          Let that server change what already exists — rows,
                           a whole table, a file. Off by default; every such
                           change is shown first and applied by name
  -h, --help               Print help
  -V, --version            Print version
```

### Browse several files

```sh
rowq orders.csv customers.csv products.parquet
```

A directory-style listing opens with each file as a row. Press `Enter` to open
one; `Esc` or `q` to go back.

### Many files as one table

```sh
rowq 'data/*.csv'
rowq 'content/**/index.md'
```

Quoted, the pattern reaches rowq and every file it matches is stacked into one
table — the listing above is for picking a file, this is for reading them together.
Unquoted, the shell expands it first and you get the listing instead. Tabular files
have to hold the same columns, and the one that does not is named rather than
folded in; markdown pages are records, so they are unioned and a field a page lacks
arrives NULL. A pattern is not a file, so the sheet has nothing to reload from and
`Ctrl+S` asks where to put it.

### Pipe mode

```sh
psql -c "SELECT * FROM orders" --csv | rowq -t csv
sqlite3 app.db ".mode csv" ".headers on" "SELECT * FROM users" | rowq -t csv
```

> Stdin accepts `csv`, `tsv`, `txt`, `json`, `jsonl`, `yaml`, and `toml`. For
> Parquet/Excel/SQLite, open the file directly.

### MCP server — let an AI assistant use the engine

`rowq --mcp` speaks the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
over stdio. An assistant handed a data file can then compute over it with
rowq instead of doing the arithmetic in its head:

```sh
claude mcp add rowq -- rowq --mcp
```

A source may be a glob — `content/**/index.md` reads every page of a static site as
one table, each page a row of its frontmatter — so a site can be checked against a
database in one call rather than through an export script.

Five tools: `rowq_inspect` (columns, types, row count, sample rows),
`rowq_query` (seventeen operations composed as a pipeline — filter, group by,
window functions, pivot, join, dedup and the rest — returning JSON or writing
xlsx/csv/parquet/sqlite), `rowq_describe` (per-column statistics),
`rowq_jq` (jq programs over nested JSON/YAML/TOML), and `rowq_calc` — any
calculation, file or no file, in 28-digit decimals with math, statistics and
finance functions, each value labelled exact, rounded or approximate. Several questions can share
one call, and one of them failing does not cost the answers beside it.

Two more appear with `--mcp-write`: `rowq_write` works out what a change would
do and answers with the exact SQL, the rows it would touch and a plan id —
writing nothing — and `rowq_write_apply` runs precisely that plan, in one
transaction, refusing if the table moved underneath it.

There is no SQL and no arbitrary code: the model sends structured operations,
each mapping onto a function rowq already had, and gets back numbers Polars
computed. The server documents itself — the tool list and usage notes are sent
to the model on connect.

Every operation is shared with a keybinding rather than written twice, and a test
holds the two surfaces together: adding an action to the terminal fails to
compile until someone says how a model reaches it.

The protocol is newline-delimited JSON-RPC, which `serde_json` already covers;
`rowq_calc` adds `rust_decimal` for exact arithmetic and `libm` for the normal
distribution, and implements the other distributions itself.

|-----|--------|-----|--------|
| `h` `j` `k` `l` | Move cursor | `[` / `]` | Sort asc / desc |
| `gg` / `G` | First / last row | `r` | Reset sort |
| `Ctrl+B` / `Ctrl+F` | Page up / down | `/` | Search (regex) |
| `!` | Pin / unpin column | `\|` | Select rows by regex / expression |
| `=` | Add computed column | `,` | Select rows by value |
| `V` | Chart column | `s` / `u` | Select / unselect row |
| `I` | Column statistics | `+` / `-` | Add / clear aggregator |
| `F` | Frequency table | `t` | Set column type |
| `W` | Pivot table | `Enter` | Transpose row / drill down / dive into node |
| `J` | JOIN with another table | `T` | Transpose table |
| `m` | Cycle JSON/YAML/TOML layout | `zEnter` | Dive into the node in this cell |
| `(` / `)` | Expand / fold a nested column | | |
| `E` | Edit cell (or node) in `$EDITOR` | `Ctrl+S` | Save / export / convert |
| `o` | Add an empty row below | `O` | New-row form, checked by column type |

| `?` | Help | `q` | Quit / pop sheet |

> Non-QWERTY layouts (ЙЦУКЕН, QWERTZ, AZERTY) are transparently remapped, so the
> hotkeys work regardless of your keyboard.

## Coming from tuitab

rowq 1.0.0 continues tuitab: the same engine, developed further under a new name. tuitab
stays available at 0.11.2 on every channel and keeps working; it gets no further releases.
The two install side by side — the commands differ (`tuitab`, `ttab`, `ttb` against `rowq`), and so do the MCP tools (`tuitab_*` against `rowq_*`). To move over, install rowq,
then remove tuitab when you no longer need it.

- **Cargo:** `cargo install rowq`, later `cargo uninstall tuitab`.
- **Homebrew:** rowq has its own tap: `brew install denisotree/rowq/rowq`, later
  `brew uninstall tuitab`.
- **AUR:** install `rowq` or `rowq-bin`; remove `tuitab` or `tuitab-bin` when you want.
- **APT:** add the rowq repository as in [Debian / Ubuntu (APT)](#debian--ubuntu-apt) and
  `apt install rowq`. The tuitab repository can stay or go; to remove it:

  ```sh
  sudo apt remove tuitab
  sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tuitab.list /usr/share/keyrings/tuitab.gpg
  ```
- **MCP in Claude Code:** register rowq, keeping `--mcp-write` if you had it, and drop the
  tuitab server once you have switched:

  ```sh
  claude mcp add -s user rowq -- rowq --mcp
  claude mcp remove tuitab
  ```

  Permission rules follow the server's name: a rule like `mcp__tuitab__tuitab_query`
  becomes `mcp__rowq__rowq_query`, and `mcp__tuitab` becomes `mcp__rowq`.
- **MCP clients configured with JSON** (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Zed and others): add a `rowq`
  entry with `"command": "rowq"` — the full path if the client needs one, such as
  `/opt/homebrew/bin/rowq`. The client derives tool names from the key: a key left as
  `tuitab` gives `mcp__tuitab__rowq_*`.
